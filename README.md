#[Ground Truth Word Error Rate: A Case Study on Luxembourgish Transcription](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hddwfrsnpxmv#234d76)
This paper introduces the Ground Truth Word Error Rate (WER), an innovative evaluation metric for speech recognition systems, particularly in the context of Luxembourgish transcription. By implementing a normalization function, we demonstrate how this metric focuses on semantic meaning rather than strict formatting, leading to more accurate assessments of transcription quality. Our results show that Ground Truth WER significantly improves performance metrics over traditional methods.
